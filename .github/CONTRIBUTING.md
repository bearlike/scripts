# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Make sure there are no functionally similar scripts, at least in the same type/language as yours may be a duplicate.
- Each PR must describe `Title`, `Filename`, `Type`, `Description` just like in the [`README.md`](README.md)
- If youâ€™re uploading more than a script, create a table describing each file as said above.
- Titles should be [capitalized](http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/capitalization/rules-for-capitalization-in-titles.html).
- Keep descriptions short and simple.
- Order titles alphabetically.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Remove trailing white spaces.
- Try to make your Pull request and title as descriptive as possible.
- New script types/languages or improvements to the existing ones are welcome.

Thank you for your suggestions!
